[2nd website, first vanilla javascript app: Tile Match puzzle](https://snowman.academy/main.html)

The main purpose of this particular simple game was to get immersed in Javascript basic structures and accomplish something meaningful and interactive - a hello world of sorts.

The second purpose was to provide an add-free puzzle for younger students who had computer time, but needed a safe place to spend time without worrying about click-bait and ads.
